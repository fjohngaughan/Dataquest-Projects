    "# Hispanic American Mental Health App Viability Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Protective measures against the spread of COVID-19, including social distancing and the heavy restriction and closure of businesses, have taken a heavy psychological and economic toll on millions of people in the United States. Anxiety, depression, and suicidality in the US have [increased significantly this year](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm), especially among racial minorities. In a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in August 2020, Hispanics, the largest ethnic minority in the US, reported higher levels of these conditions than non-hispanic whites and non-hispanic Asians.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current circumstances highlight the already low levels of mental health services sought and received by Hispanic-Americans. [Barriers to treatment](https://www.mhanational.org/issues/latinxhispanic-communities-and-mental-health) include cultural stigma around speaking about or seeking help for mental health disorders; avoiding therapy for religious reasons; language barriers; cultural differences in describing symptoms; insufficient health insurance coverage; and legal status. \n",
    "\n",
    "Self-care mental health apps are one solution to address these obstacles. Such apps which are an easy, private, and often free medium to receive mental health information and some of the benefits of traditional therapy. On a global scale, apps in this category are being downloaded and used at a rapidly increasing rate--[they reportedly generated](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mental-health-apps-market-accounted-for-us-587-9-mn-in-2018-and-is-expected-to-generate-a-revenue-of-us-3-918-40-mn-by-2027--at-a-growth-rate-of-23-7-from-2019--2027--300997559.html) almost \\\\$600 million in revenue globally in 2018, and are expected to bring in close to \\\\$4 billion by 2027. While the majority of these apps have not been subject to scientific studies to determine their effectiveness, most mental health experts agree they are a useful tool when based on best practices, especially if combined with traditional therapy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of self-care mental health apps could make them a particularly good solution for Hispanics. The privacy and low cost (or no cost) of apps addresses both common cultural and socioeconomic barriers. *However, only about half or less of mental health apps built in English are available in Spanish, and few apps have been built from the ground up to meet the unique mental health needs of Hispanic-Americans.* \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will look at datasets to, I) determine if there is indeed a niche opportunity to develop a self-care mental health app specifically designed for Hispanic-Americans; and II) look for insights in the data that can inform and improve the app concept.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "[As of September 2020](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/), Google Play has the most content of any app store in the world with 2.87 million apps; Apple's App Store trails them with 1.96 million. Due to their market dominance and the availability of datasets, we will analyze data from the App Store and Google Play. Specifically, we'll use two datasets from 2018 posted on Kaggle. One provides data on 7,197 apps from the App Store, and the other on 10,841 apps from Google Play.\n",

    "# Analyzing The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have clean, relevant data in DataFrames, we can start our analysis. We want to determine if there is a market opportunity for a self-care mental health app designed for Hispanic-Americans. While many Hispanic-Americans are bi-lingual or only speak English, as of 2017 over [40 million Americans](https://archive.vn/20200214011034/https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_1YR_S1601&prodType=table) speak Spanish in their home. Given that there were [60 million Hispanics in the US in 2017], it's reasonable to assume that Spanish is the preferred language of at least half, if not a majority, of Hispanic-Americans. Thus, whether a self-care mental health app is built in Spanish or available in Spanish will be our primary criteria for determining potential competitors. Specifically, we want to know about:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. Self-care mental health apps built in Spanish for Hispanics\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Unfortunately, its apparent from reviewing the data that no apps with Spanish names made it into the datasets. We know from searches that there are apps written in Spanish on both app platforms, especially Google Play. As a \"poor man's\" alternative to gauge how much competition is out there, we'll review the top 10 search results on the App Store and Google Play for the search terms \"salud mental\" (\"mental health\"), \"depresión\" (\"depression\"), and \"ansiedad\" (\"anxiety\"), and make dictionaries of all relevant apps built in Spanish and of all relevants apps built in other languages. We'll then compare the sizes of both groups. (Using current search results means we're mixing some 2020 data with 2018 data. This is conscious trade-off even though it slightly undermines the integrity of our analysis.) \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. Self-care mental health apps built in another language that are available in Spanish\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For this, we can look at the \"lang.num\" (number of langauges) column in the original App Store dataset, which indicates whether the app could be available in Spanish. Because the Google Play dataset does not include a column showing number of languages, we cannot use that dataset for this step. To compensate, we've produced a table of 11 sample self-care mental health apps, showing which include a Spanish language option. \n",
